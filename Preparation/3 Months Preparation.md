				Create an application using Spring boot React CRUD with Maven. Add additional jasper report microservice to support your Rest API. Use JWT Token for Authentication and Deploy on AWS or Heroku (deployment is optional) Create user. Users can add, delete and update microblogs. Create a report of word counts, most used words, if you have time add the number of views to blog or comments. Make sure you follow Uncle Bob's clean code philosophy.
				Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the development of a scalable and real-time chat application using Spring Boot, Kafka, and Redis:
					*Scalable Chat Application:*
						1. *Backend with Spring Boot:*
						   - Create a Spring Boot application to handle the backend logic.
						   - Implement user authentication, registration, and user management.
						   - Use Spring WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication.
						2. *Message Handling with Kafka:*
						   - Integrate Apache Kafka for managing message queues.
						   - Implement Kafka topics for different chat channels or rooms.
						   - Use Kafka for asynchronous communication between the server and clients.
						1. *Real-time Updates:*
						   - Enable real-time updates by pushing messages to connected clients using WebSockets.
						   - Implement Kafka consumers to handle message broadcasting to relevant chat channels.
						4. *User Presence and Notifications:*
						   - Utilize Redis to keep track of user presence (online/offline status).
						   - Implement notifications for users when they receive new messages or when others join or leave a chat.
						5. *Multiple Chat Channels:*
						   - Allow users to create and join multiple chat channels or rooms.
						   - Use Kafka topics to manage communication within specific channels.
						6. *Message History and Persistence:*
						   - Implement a mechanism to store chat history for each channel.
						   - Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed message history.
						7. *Security Considerations:*
						   - Implement secure user authentication and authorization.
						   - Apply encryption for message transmission over WebSockets.
						8. *Scalability and Load Balancing:*
						   - Design the architecture to be scalable by deploying multiple instances of the application.
						   - Consider using load balancing for distributing incoming connections.
						9. *Monitoring and Logging:*
						   - Implement monitoring features using tools like Spring Boot Actuator.
						   - Integrate logging to capture and analyze system behavior.
						10. *Deployment and Containerization:*
						    - Deploy the application using containerization tools like Docker.
						    - Utilize orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing containers.
						By working on this chat application, you'll gain hands-on experience in building a real-time system, handling distributed messaging with Kafka, utilizing Redis for caching, and ensuring scalability and security in a chat-basedÂ environment.
