Docker
	difference btw container and image
	layering of image (imp)
	internal arch of docker (daemon, client and their working)
	attached and detached mode 
	anonymous volumes and other volume types(overwrite by which type over other)
	copy vs bind mount (why bind mount is only used in the development phase and in the prod phase, the bind mounts must be deleted)
